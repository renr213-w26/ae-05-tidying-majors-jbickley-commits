## Goal

Our ultimate goal in this application exercise is to make the following data visualization.

![](images/statsci-plot.png){fig-alt="Line plot of numbers of Statistical Science majors over the years (2011 - 2021). Degree types represented are BS, BS2, AB, AB2. There is an increasing trend in BS degrees and somewhat steady trend in AB degrees." fig-align="center"}

## Data

The data come from Duke's Office of the University Registrar. The data were downloaded from Duke as a PDF file. The data have been exported to a CSV file for you. Let's load that in.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages-data
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

statsci <- read_csv("data/statsci.csv")
```

And let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
statsci
```

## Pivoting

-   **Demo:** Pivot the `statsci` data frame *longer* such that each row represents a degree type / year combination and `year` and `n`umber of graduates for that year are columns in the data frame.

```{r}
#| label: pivot

statsci |> pivot_longer(cols = -degree, names_to = "year", values_to = "n")  
  
```

-   **Question:** What is the type of the `year` variable? Why? What should it be?

*Add your response here.*

-   **Demo:** Start over with pivoting, and this time also make sure `year` is a numerical variable in the resulting data frame.

```{r}
#| label: pivot-with-transform

statsci |> pivot_longer(cols = -degree, names_to = "year", names_transform = as.numeric, values_to = "n")  
```

-   **Question:** What does an `NA` mean in this context? *Hint:* The data come from the university registrar, and they have records on every single graduates, there shouldn't be anything "unknown" to them about who graduated when.

They represent 0s for that row entry

-   **Demo:** Add on to your pipeline that you started with pivoting and convert `NA`s in `n` to `0`s.

```{r}

#| label: convert-na

statsci |> pivot_longer(cols = -degree, names_to = "year", names_transform = as.numeric, values_to = "n") |> mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n),0,n)) 
```

-   **Demo:** In our plot the degree types are BS, BS2, AB, and AB2. This information is in our dataset, in the `degree` column, but this column also has additional characters we don't need. Create a new column called `degree_type` with levels BS, BS2, AB, and AB2 (in this order) based on `degree`. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{r}
#| label: degree-type

statsci |> pivot_longer(cols = -degree, names_to = "year", names_transform = as.numeric, values_to = "n") |> mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n),0,n)) |> separate_wider_delim(degree, delim = "(", names = c("Major", "degree_type")) |>
  mutate(degree_type = str_remove(degree_type, "\\)"),
         degree_type = fct_relevel(degree_type, "BS","BS2","AB","AB2"))
  
  
```

-   **Your turn:** Now we start making our plot, but let's not get too fancy right away. Create the following plot, which will serve as the "first draft" on the way to our [Goal]. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

![](images/statsci-plot-draft.png){fig-alt="Line plot of numbers of Statistical Science majors over the years (2011 - 2021). Degree types represented are BS, BS2, AB, AB2. There is an increasing trend in BS degrees and somewhat steady trend in AB degrees." fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: plot-draft

statsci |> pivot_longer(cols = -degree, names_to = "year", names_transform = as.numeric, values_to = "n") |> mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n),0,n)) |> separate_wider_delim(degree, delim = "(", names = c("Major", "degree_type")) |>
  mutate(degree_type = str_remove(degree_type, "\\)"),
         degree_type = fct_relevel(degree_type, "BS","BS2","AB","AB2"))|> ggplot(aes(year, n, color=degree_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2023, 2))+
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() 

```

-   **Your turn:** What aspects of the plot need to be updated to go from the draft you created above to the [Goal] plot at the beginning of this application exercise.

*Add your response here.*

-   **Demo:** Update x-axis scale such that the years displayed go from 2011 to 2023 in increments of 2 years. Do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.

```{r}

statsci |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -degree,
    names_to = "year",
    names_transform = as.numeric,
    values_to = "n"
  ) |>
  mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n), 0, n)) |>
  separate_wider_delim(
    degree,
    delim = "(",
    names = c("Major", "degree_type")
  ) |>
  mutate(
    degree_type = str_remove(degree_type, "\\)"),
    degree_type = fct_relevel(degree_type, "BS", "BS2", "AB", "AB2")
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(year, n, color = degree_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2023, 2)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_manual(
  values = c("cadetblue4", "cadetblue3", "lightgoldenrod4", "lightgoldenrod3")
)

```

-   **Demo:** Update line colors using the following level / color assignments. Once again, do this by adding on to your pipeline from earlier.
    -   "BS" = "cadetblue4"

    -   "BS2" = "cadetblue3"

    -   "AB" = "lightgoldenrod4"

    -   "AB2" = "lightgoldenrod3"

```{r}

statsci |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -degree,
    names_to = "year",
    names_transform = as.numeric,
    values_to = "n"
  ) |>
  mutate(n = if_else(is.na(n), 0, n)) |>
  separate_wider_delim(
    degree,
    delim = "(",
    names = c("Major", "degree_type")
  ) |>
  mutate(
    degree_type = str_remove(degree_type, "\\)"),
    degree_type = fct_relevel(degree_type, "BS", "BS2", "AB", "AB2")
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(year, n, color = degree_type)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2023, 2)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_manual(
  values = c("cadetblue4", "cadetblue3", "lightgoldenrod4", "lightgoldenrod3")
)+
  labs( x = "Year", y = "Number of Students Graduating", color = "Degree Type", title = "Stastical Sciecne Majors over Years", subtitle="Academic years 2011-2023", caption = "SOURCE:" )

```


-   **Demo:** Finally, adding to your pipeline you've developed so far, move the legend into the plot, make its background white, and its border gray. Set `fig-width: 7` and `fig-height: 5` for your plot in the chunk options.

  separate_wider_delim(

    degree_type = fct_relevel(degree_type, "BS", "BS2", "AB", "AB2")

)+
  labs( x = "Year", y = "Number of Students Graduating", color = "Degree Type", title = "Stastical Sciecne Majors over Years", subtitle="Academic years 2011-2023", caption = "SOURCE:" )+
  theme(legend.position = c(0.2,.8), legend.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "grey"))
```
